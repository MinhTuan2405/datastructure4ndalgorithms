# In Python, a list is a built-in dynamic sized array (automatically grows and shrinks). We can store all types of items (including another list) in a list. 
# A list may contain mixed type of items, this is possible because a list mainly stores references at contiguous locations and actual items maybe stored at different locations.

# List can contain duplicate items.
# List in Python are Mutable. Hence, we can modify, replace or delete the items.
# List are ordered. It maintain the order of elements based on how they are added.
# Accessing items in List can be done directly using their position (index), starting from 0.
##############################################################################################
# Note: Lists Store References, Not Values
# Each element in a list is not stored directly inside the list structure. Instead, the list stores references (pointers) to the actual objects in memory.
# Example (from the image representation). 

# The list a itself is a container with references (addresses) to the actual values.
# Python internally creates separate objects for 10, 20, "GfG", 40 and True, then stores their memory addresses inside a.
# This means that modifying an element doesnâ€™t affect other elements but can affect the referenced object if it is mutable

# normally
a = [1, 3]
# using the constructor
b = list ([1, 3, 4])

# Creating List with Repeated Elements
# Create a list [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
a = [2] * 5

# Create a list [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
b = [0] * 7

# multidimesion array
a = [[0] * 10] * 10 # 10x10 array

for subarray in a:
    for item in subarray:
        print(item, sep=" ", end=" ")
    print()
